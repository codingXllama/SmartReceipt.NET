# SmartReceipt.NET
ðŸ§¾**SmartReceipt**.NET is a C# application designed to scan receipts and extract essential purchase information.


### E - Issue / Environment

1. Most receipt scanning apps collect user data and may share it with third parties, exposing users to unwanted advertising.
2. Many receipts accumulate without providing meaningful insight into daily expenses or spending habits.
3. Users often lack clarity on item costs, making it difficult to find the best prices at different stores or markets.
4. People may not know which purchases are driven by necessity versus emotional spending.


### S - Solution / Strategy

MVP Expectations:
  1. Users can upload images of receipts for processing.
  2. The application automatically identifies and displays:
  3. Date of purchase
  4. Total amount spent
  5. Itemized list of purchased products with prices
  6. Provides a clear, easy-to-read summary of expenses.
  7. Protects user privacy by ensuring that no personal information is collected or shared.
