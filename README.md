### E â€“ Issue / Environment

1. Most receipt scanning apps collect user data and may share it with third parties, exposing users to unwanted advertising.
2. Many receipts accumulate without providing meaningful insight into daily expenses or spending habits.

4. People may not know which purchases are driven by necessity versus emotional spending.
